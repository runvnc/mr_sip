JACK Audio Capture (Future Implementation)

Direct audio capture from baresip via JACK, eliminating file I/O completely.
This provides the lowest possible latency for audio capture.

NOTE: This is a placeholder/documentation file. Implementation is deferred
to keep the initial Deepgram integration simple and stable.

## Architecture

Instead of:
  SIP Call → baresip → WAV file → inotify → STT

We would have:
  SIP Call → baresip → JACK → Ring Buffer → STT

## Implementation Plan

1. Create JACK input port in JACKAudioStreamer
2. Connect to baresip's decoded audio output port
3. Use ring buffer to store incoming audio
4. Feed audio chunks directly to STT provider

## Benefits

- Eliminates file I/O overhead (~50-100ms)
- No disk writes (better for SSDs)
- Lower CPU usage (no file polling)
- More reliable (no file system issues)
- Cleaner architecture

## Code Sketch

```python
class JACKAudioCapture:
    def __init__(self, callback):
        self.client = jack.Client("MindRootCapture")
        self.inport = self.client.inports.register('input')
        self.buffer = jack.RingBuffer(sample_rate * 20 * 4)
        self.callback = callback
        
    def process(self, frames):
        # JACK callback - runs in real-time thread
        audio = self.inport.get_array()
        self.buffer.write(audio.tobytes())
        
    async def read_loop(self):
        # Async loop to read from buffer and feed to STT
        while self.is_running:
            if self.buffer.read_space >= chunk_size:
                data = self.buffer.read(chunk_size)
                audio = np.frombuffer(data, dtype=np.float32)
                await self.callback(audio)
            else:
                await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
```

## Integration Points

1. Modify sip_client.py to choose between InotifyAudioCapture and JACKAudioCapture
2. Add configuration option: AUDIO_CAPTURE_METHOD="jack" or "inotify"
3. Keep inotify as fallback if JACK setup fails

## Testing Strategy

1. Test JACK capture independently
2. Compare latency with inotify method
3. Verify audio quality (no dropouts)
4. Test with multiple simultaneous calls
5. Measure CPU usage difference

## When to Implement

Implement this when:
- Deepgram integration is stable and tested
- Latency requirements demand it (<500ms total)
- File I/O becomes a bottleneck
- Multiple simultaneous calls are needed
